## Decision Surfaces with 9 Different DataSets

- I explore the diversity of decision surfaces across 9 distinct datasets using Machine Learningâœ¨.
- Each dataset presents a unique challengeðŸŽ¨, from linearly separable data to complex nonlinear relationships. 
- Through visualization ðŸ’¥, I gain insights into how different classifiers interpret and partition the feature space.

### Each DataSet with its own unique characteristics, including ðŸ‘‡ :
1. U-Shape
2. Concentric1
3. Concentric2
4. Linearly Separable 
5. Outlier
6. Overlap
7. XOR
8. Two Spirals
9. Random 
- I created vibrant visualizations for each oneðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰.
